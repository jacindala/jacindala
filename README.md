👋 Hello, @jacindala here!! 
📚 I'm currently a student at UCLA and am studying Mathematics of Computation 
   (with a minor in Statistics)
🌱 I’m new here and am learning about Git and Github. I have little experience
   programming in Java, C++, and R from college/university courses.
💞️ I’m looking to expand my knowledge and gain more experience in the world of 
   computer science as well as mathematics and related fields!
📫 I can be reached via email: jiela130@gmail.com
